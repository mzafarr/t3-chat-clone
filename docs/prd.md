That's a fair and direct question. I will be equally direct in my answer.

**I accidentally did that.**

My internal state was locked into the "brownfield merger" workflow we initially chose. As a result, the documents I generated were a reflection of that processâ€”an *analysis of a merger*â€”rather than the clean, forward-looking blueprints for a new, standalone product.

It was a mistake in framing, not in technical substance. The core decisions (using Convex, using the T3 UI, the direct-to-Convex architecture) were correct and aligned with your instructions, but the *presentation* and *narrative* of the documents were wrong. They read like an internal memo about how we're combining two things, not like the official, canonical documentation for a new product.

You were absolutely right to call it out. It was a failure on my part to adapt my output to the true spirit of the project once we had all the information.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to correct it. I will now generate the new, properly framed documents.

### **Regenerating the Master Blueprints**

I will now create the two master documents for **"T3.chat Superior"**. These will be written as if this is a new, greenfield project, defining its vision and architecture from first principles. The fact that we are leveraging existing code is now an implementation detail, not the story itself.

Here are the new, official documents.

# T3.chat Superior Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Product Vision
To create a premium, feature-rich, and highly performant AI chat application that offers a superior user experience. T3.chat Superior will be the go-to platform for users who demand deep customization, multi-modal capabilities, and a fast, intuitive interface.

### 1.2. Core Goals
*   **User Experience:** Deliver an exceptionally fast, fluid, and aesthetically pleasing interface.
*   **Feature Set:** Provide a powerful feature set from day one, including multi-modal chat, advanced model selection, and robust customization.
*   **Architecture:** Establish a secure, extensible, and scalable serverless architecture.
*   **Monetization:** Implement a flexible, database-driven configuration for subscription plans, credits, and usage limits.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Power Users & Developers:** Users who value advanced features, API key management, and developer-friendly tools like high-quality syntax highlighting.
*   **Creative Professionals:** Users who need multi-modal capabilities like image generation and document analysis.
*   **General Users:** Users seeking a premium, reliable, and highly polished chat experience beyond basic offerings.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Core Chat Experience
*   **FR1:** Users must authenticate via a secure email/password system.
*   **FR2:** The application must provide a real-time, streaming chat interface powered by the Vercel AI SDK.
*   **FR3:** Users must be able to create, rename, pin, and delete chat conversations.
*   **FR4:** Chat history must be persisted and synchronized for authenticated users.

### 3.2. AI & Model Interaction
*   **FR5:** Users must be able to select from a list of available LLMs, with access controlled by their subscription plan.
*   **FR6:** The system must support multi-modal inputs, including PDF and TXT file uploads for context.
*   **FR7:** The system must support advanced AI SDK features, including Language Model Middleware for extensibility.
*   **FR8:** Code blocks rendered in the chat must have language-appropriate syntax highlighting.

### 3.3. SaaS & User Management
*   **FR9:** The application will enforce a metered usage system based on "Standard" and "Premium" credits.
*   **FR10:** The system will support a "Free" and "Pro" subscription plan, with limits and features defined in the database.
*   **FR11:** A user-facing dashboard will provide usage analytics.

### 3.4. Customization & Features
*   **FR12:** Users must be able to customize their AI's persona (name, traits, etc.) via a settings dashboard.
*   **FR13:** The application must support multiple UI themes, and the user's selection must be persisted.
*   **FR14:** A separate UI and backend function will be provided for dedicated image generation.
*   **FR15 (Post-MVP):** The architecture will support a future audio-to-audio chat feature.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1 (Performance):** The UI must feel instantaneous, using optimistic updates for user actions.
*   **NFR2 (Security):** The architecture must be "zero-trust," with all business logic and external API calls executed and validated on the server (Convex).
*   **NFR3 (Extensibility):** The architecture must use abstraction layers for key external services to simplify future maintenance.
*   **NFR4 (Configurability):** All system-level configurations (plans, models, limits) must be stored in the database for dynamic management without requiring a code deployment.

## 5. High-Level Epic Plan
*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication:** Establish the project structure and implement a complete, working authentication flow.
*   **Epic 2: Core Chat UI & Data Persistence:** Connect the UI to the backend to display and manage live chat data.
*   **Epic 3: Vercel AI SDK & Multi-Modal Core:** Implement the advanced AI interaction engine with streaming and multi-modal capabilities.
*   **Epic 4: The SaaS Engine - Plans & Credits:** Build the backend system for subscription plans and metered usage.
*   **Epic 5: The Power User Hub - Dashboard & New Features:** Build the backend for the settings dashboard and implement the image generation feature.
